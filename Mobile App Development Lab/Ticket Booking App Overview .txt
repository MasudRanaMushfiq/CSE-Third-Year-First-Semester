### Project Name: Ticket Booking App

#### Overview:
Ticket Booking App is a mobile application designed to simplify bus and train ticket booking in Bangladesh. It allows users to search, book, and manage their travel tickets digitally, offering real-time seat availability, online payments, and booking history. The goal is to make travel in Bangladesh faster, easier, and more transparent for everyone — whether in rural or urban areas.

#### The Problem:
Manual ticketing systems in Bangladesh are often slow, crowded, and lack transparency. Passengers frequently face long queues, confusion about schedules, and limited access to accurate seat or price information. Both rural and urban travelers need a reliable, digital platform to handle their bookings conveniently and efficiently.

Ticket Booking App provides a unified platform for bus and train bookings. Users can search available routes, check seat availability in real-time, and complete payments securely through the app. The app also ensures smooth access for returning users with secure login and personalized booking history.
